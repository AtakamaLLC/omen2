## Relation(Selectable) [T=ObjBase]
Omen2: One to many relationship helper.


#### .add(self, obj:'ObjBase')
Add object to relation.

If relation is unbound, the object is stored in ram until the relation object is committed.

TODO: could allow adding by **kws primary key (like m2m adds)


#### .commit(self, manager=None)
Bind/add any items were added while I was unbound.

TODO: relation-with-blocks that track changes, just like their parents.


#### .is\_bound(self)
Is this relation bound to the db.

#### .remove(self, obj:'ObjBase')
Remove object from relation.

TODO: could allow removing by **kws primary key (like m2m removes)


#### .select(self, \_where={}, **kws) -> Iterable[~T]
Works like select on the related table, except it is filtered by those matching my relation.

Example using lambda, can be useful if 'driverid' is autogenerated:

    self.drivers = gen_objs.drivers_relation(
        self, where={"id": lambda: self.driverid}, cascade=False
    )
